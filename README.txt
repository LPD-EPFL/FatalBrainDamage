Fatal Brain Damage paper code

To run a Jupyter notebook:
1. Install miniconda https://conda.io/miniconda.html for Python 3.6.6
2. Install requirements from requirements.txt
3. Activate Freeze nbextension to skip the computation cells automatically and just plot data from pickled results

All results are pickled so that the figures can be generated without running the computation again

Tested on a 12CPU machine with 2xGPU NVIDIA GTX 1080
